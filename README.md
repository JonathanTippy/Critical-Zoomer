# Critical Zoomer
a mandelbrot set zoomer for potato pc people

## Current state of the project
- not worth using for majority of fractal enthusiasts
- has to be recompiled for a specific view

## Current Goals of the Project
- easy to use with not confusing gui:
will work on this soon
- faster than Xaos, while zooming infinitely:
verified to be possible, currently working on it
- coloring methods which provide both intricate detail and don't devolve into static at high-density areas:
don't know if it is possible, secondary to first goal
